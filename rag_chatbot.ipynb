POLIVY in combination with bendamustine and a rituximab product (BR) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, NOS, after at least two prior therapies.  Important Safety Information Peripheral Neuropathy POLIVY can cause severe peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy occurs as early as the first cycle of treatment and is cumulative. POLIVY may exacerbate preexisting peripheral neuropathy. In POLARIX, of 435 patients treated with POLIVY plus R-CHP, 53% reported new or worsening peripheral neuropathy, with a median time to onset of 2.3 months. Peripheral neuropathy was Grade 1 in 39% of patients, Grade 2 in 12%, and Grade 3 in 1.6%. Peripheral neuropathy resulted in dose reduction in 4% of treated patients and treatment discontinuation in 0.7%. Among patients with peripheral neuropathy after POLIVY, 58% reported resolution after a median of 4 months. In Study GO29365, of 173 patients treated with POLIVY, 40% reported new or worsening peripheral neuropathy, with a median time to onset of 2.1 months. Peripheral neuropathy was Grade 1 in 26% of patients, Grade 2 in 12%, and Grade 3 in 2.3%. Peripheral neuropathy resulted in POLIVY dose reduction in 2.9% of treated patients, dose delay in 1.2%, and permanent discontinuation in 2.9%. Sixty-five percent of patients reported improvement or resolution of peripheral neuropathy after a median of 1 month, and 48% reported complete resolution. The peripheral neuropathy is predominantly sensory; however, motor and sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy also occur. Monitor for symptoms of peripheral neuropathy such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, dysesthesia, neuropathic pain, burning sensation, weakness, or gait disturbance. Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy may require a delay, dose reduction, or discontinuation of POLIVY. Infusion-Related Reactions POLIVY can cause severe infusion reactions. Delayed infusion-related reactions as late as 24 hours after receiving POLIVY have occurred. With premedication, 13% of patients (58/435) in POLARIX reported infusion-related reactions after the administration of POLIVY plus R-CHP. The reactions were Grade 1 in 4.4% of patients, Grade 2 in 8%, and Grade 3 in 1.1%. With premedication, 7% of patients (12/173) in Study GO29365 reported infusion-related reactions after the administration of POLIVY. The reactions were Grade 1 in 4.6% of patients, Grade 2 in 1.7%, and Grade 3 in 0.6%. Symptoms occurring in ≥1% of patients included chills, dyspnea, pyrexia, pruritus, rash, and chest discomfort. Administer an antihistamine and antipyretic prior to the administration of POLIVY, and monitor patients closely throughout the infusion. If an infusion-related reaction occurs, interrupt the infusion and institute appropriate medical management. Myelosuppression Treatment with POLIVY can cause serious or severe myelosuppression, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. In POLARIX, 90% of patients treated with POLIVY plus R-CHP had primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Grade 3–4 hematologic adverse reactions included lymphopenia (44%), neutropenia (39%), febrile neutropenia (15%), anemia (14%), and thrombocytopenia (8%). In Study GO29365, in patients treated with POLIVY plus BR (n = 45), 42% received primary prophylaxis with G-CSF. Grade 3 or higher hematologic adverse reactions included neutropenia (42%), thrombocytopenia (40%), anemia (24%), lymphopenia (13%), and febrile neutropenia (11%). Grade 4 hematologic adverse reactions included neutropenia (24%), thrombocytopenia (16%), lymphopenia (9%), and febrile neutropenia (4.4%). Cytopenias were the most common reason for treatment discontinuation (18% of all patients). Monitor complete blood counts throughout treatment. Cytopenias may require a delay, dose reduction, or discontinuation of POLIVY. Administer prophylactic G-CSF for neutropenia in patients receiving POLIVY plus R-CHP. Consider prophylactic G-CSF administration in patients receiving POLIVY plus bendamustine and a rituximab product. Serious and Opportunistic Infections Fatal and/or serious infections, including opportunistic infections such as sepsis, pneumonia (including Pneumocystis jiroveci and other fungal pneumonia), herpesvirus infection, and cytomegalovirus infection have occurred in patients treated with POLIVY. In POLARIX, Grade 3–4 infections occurred in 14% (61/435) of patients treated with POLIVY plus R-CHP, and infection-related deaths were reported in 1.1% of patients. In Study GO29365, Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 32% (55/173) of patients treated with POLIVY, and infection-related deaths were reported in 2.9% of patients within 90 days of last treatment. Closely monitor patients during treatment for signs of infection. Administer prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and herpesvirus. Administer prophylactic G-CSF for neutropenia as recommended. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) PML has been reported after treatment with POLIVY plus bendamustine and obinutuzumab in Study GO29365 (0.6%, 1/173). Monitor for new or worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioral changes. Hold POLIVY and any concomitant chemotherapy if PML is suspected, and permanently discontinue if the diagnosis is confirmed. Tumor Lysis Syndrome POLIVY may cause tumor lysis syndrome. Patients with high tumor burden and rapidly proliferative tumor may be at increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Monitor closely and take appropriate measures, including tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis. Hepatotoxicity Serious cases of hepatotoxicity that were consistent with hepatocellular injury, including elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin, have occurred in patients treated with POLIVY. In recipients of POLIVY plus R-CHP, Grade 3–4 elevation of ALT and AST developed in 1.4% and 0.7% of patients, respectively. In Study GO29365, Grade 3 and Grade 4 transaminase elevations each developed in 1.9% of patients. Preexisting liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin level. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, POLIVY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The small molecule component of POLIVY, monomethyl auristatin E, administered to rats caused adverse developmental outcomes, including embryo-fetal mortality and structural abnormalities, at exposures below those occurring clinically at the recommended dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with POLIVY and for 3 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with POLIVY and for 5 months after the last dose. The Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions (≥20%), excluding laboratory abnormalities, in patients with previously untreated DLBCL treated with POLIVY in combination with R-CHP are peripheral neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, alopecia, and mucositis. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥10%) are lymphopenia, neutropenia, hyperuricemia, and anemia. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL treated with POLIVY in combination with BR are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, decreased appetite, and pneumonia. Lactation Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with POLIVY and for 2 months after the last dose. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. You may also report side effects to Genentech at 1-888-835-2555. Please see the full Prescribing Information for additional Important Safety Information.

Immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), including life-threatening and fatal reactions, can occur with EPKINLY. Monitor patients for neurological signs or symptoms of ICANS during treatment. Withhold EPKINLY until ICANS resolves or permanently discontinue based on severity.   CRS CRS occurred in 51% of patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) in the clinical trial (37% grade 1, 17% grade 2, and 2.5% grade 3) and recurred in 16% of patients. Most events (92%) occurred during cycle 1, with 61% occurring after the 48 mg dose on cycle 1, day 15. CRS occurred in 49% of patients with FL receiving the recommended 3-step up dosage schedule in the clinical trial (45% grade 1, 9% grade 2) and recurred in 23% of patients. Most events (88%) occurred during cycle 1, with 49% occurring after the 48 mg dose on cycle 1, day 22. In patients who experienced CRS, the signs and symptoms included pyrexia, hypotension, hypoxia, dyspnea, chills, and tachycardia. Concurrent neurological adverse reactions associated with CRS occurred in 2.5% of patients with LBCL (reactions included headache, confusional state, tremors, dizziness, and ataxia) and 4.7% of patients with FL (reactions included headache and dizziness). Administer pretreatment medications to reduce the risk of CRS. Patients with DLBCL or high-grade B-cell lymphoma should be hospitalized for 24 hours following administration of the first full 48 mg dose. Monitor patients for potential CRS. At the first signs or symptoms of CRS, manage per current practice guidelines and administer supportive care as appropriate. ICANS ICANS occurred in 6% of patients with LBCL in the clinical trial (4.5% grade 1, 1.3% grade 2, 0.6% fatal). Of the 10 ICANS events, 9 occurred in cycle 1 of treatment. ICANS occurred in 6% of patients with FL receiving the 2-step up dosage schedule in the clinical trial (3.9% grade 1, 2.4% grade 2). The onset of ICANS can be concurrent with CRS, following resolution of CRS, or in the absence of CRS. Clinical manifestations of ICANS included, but were not limited to, confusional state, lethargy, tremor, dysgraphia, aphasia, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. Monitor patients for potential ICANS. At the first signs or symptoms of ICANS, manage per current practice guidelines and administer supportive care as appropriate. Infections EPKINLY can cause serious and fatal infections. Serious infections, including opportunistic infections, were reported in 15% of patients with LBCL in the clinical trial (most common: 4.5% sepsis, 3.2% pneumonia). Fatal infections occurred in 1.3% of patients (1.3% COVID-19). Serious infections, including opportunistic infections, were reported in 40% of patients with FL receiving the 2-step up dosage schedule in the clinical trial (most common: 20% COVID-19, 13% pneumonia, 3% urinary tract infections). Fatal infections occurred in 6% of patients (5% COVID-19, 0.8% pneumonia, 0.8% sepsis). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during treatment and treat appropriately. Avoid administration in patients with active infections. Withhold or consider permanent discontinuation of EPKINLY based on severity. Prior to starting EPKINLY, provide Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis and consider prophylaxis against herpes virus. Cytopenias EPKINLY can cause serious or severe cytopenias. In the clinical trial of patients with LBCL, grade 3 or 4 events occurred in 32% (neutrophils decreased), 12% (hemoglobin decreased), and 12% (platelets decreased). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 2.5%. In the clinical trial of patients with FL receiving the 2-step up dosage schedule, grade 3 or 4 events occurred in 30% (neutrophils decreased), 10% (hemoglobin decreased), and 8% (platelets decreased). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 3.1%. Monitor complete blood counts throughout treatment. Based on severity of cytopenias, temporarily withhold or permanently discontinue EPKINLY. Consider prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration as applicable. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity EPKINLY may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with EPKINLY and for 4 months after the last dose. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating EPKINLY. Adverse Reactions DLBCL/HGBCL: Most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were CRS, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, injection site reactions, pyrexia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Most common grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥10%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, decreased white blood cells, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased platelets. FL: Most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were injection site reactions, CRS, COVID-19, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, musculoskeletal pain, rash, diarrhea, pyrexia, cough, and headache. The most common grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥10%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, decreased white blood cells, and decreased hemoglobin. Use in Specific Populations Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of EPKINLY. Geriatric Use: In patients with relapsed or refractory FL who received EPKINLY in the clinical trial, 52% were ≥65 years old, and 13% were ≥75 years old. A higher rate of fatal adverse reactions, primarily infections, including COVID-19, was observed in patients ≥65 years old compared to younger adult patients. No overall difference in efficacy was observed. INDICATIONS EPKINLY is indicated for the treatment of adults with: relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), not otherwise specified (NOS), including DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma, and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy. relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy. These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and durability of response.

Information on subsequent treatment was collected per protocol, but no formal analyses were conducted. POLARIX was a global trial: availability of subsequent therapy options and local practice patterns varied. New anti-lymphoma therapy\n",
