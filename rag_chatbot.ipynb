            "The EPCORE NHL-1 trial evaluated the efficacy of EPKINLY in treating anemia in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma, and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL). The primary endpoint of the trial was the objective response rate (ORR), which includes complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Secondary endpoints included CR rate, duration of response (DOR), duration of CR (DOCR), and time to response. The dosing schedule for EPKINLY involved administering 48 mg subcutaneously weekly for cycles 1-3, every other week for cycles 4-9, and every 4 weeks for cycles 10 and beyond. Patients continued to receive EPKINLY until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Adverse reactions included cytokine release syndrome (CRS), with most reactions occurring early in treatment (cycles 1-3) and decreasing after 12 weeks. The trial showed low discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions, and dosage interruptions were required in some patients due to adverse reactions such as CRS, neutropenia, sepsis, and thrombocytopenia.\n"
